        <p> As I was doing this activity, I was shocked by the fact that in creating a website. It was not just HTML that does all the work, 
            CSS or Cascading Style Sheets and Javascript are also part of the work in creating a beautiful and easy-to-navigate website.
            It is like programming but it involves scripting. </p>
